# Library
A simple web application built with Flask that lets users manage a personal book collection. It uses SQLite for data storage, Flask-WTF for form handling, SQLAlchemy for database operations, and Bootstrap 5 for styling. Users can add, edit, and rate books, storing details like title, author, and rating.
